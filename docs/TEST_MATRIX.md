# Search Tool Test Matrix

Last updated: 2026-09-29.

Legend: PASS = exercised successfully. PARTIAL = path works but final evidence is incomplete. BLOCKED = environment dependency unavailable. TODO = not yet exercised to the desired release standard.

| Area | Status | Evidence / note |
|---|---|---|
| cargo fmt | PASS | Latest Windows release gate |
| cargo clippy -D warnings | PASS | Latest Windows release gate |
| workspace unit tests | PASS | 93 tests total: 68 core + 7 platform + 9 CLI + 3 service + 6 worker |
| Windows release build/link | PASS | Physical Windows x64 |
| CLI smoke | PASS | Release gate |
| Initial NTFS MFT index | PASS | Isolated VHD + real C: |
| USN incremental sync | PASS | Isolated VHD + real C: service; steady-state create/rename/delete probe 4/4 PASS |
| Journal reset/truncation recovery | PASS | Isolated VHD only |
| Deep verify / repair | PASS | Real and isolated indexes |
| Multi-volume search | PASS | D:/E: validation indexes |
| External delta compaction | PASS | 140k+ delta stress exercised |
| Mutation lock | PASS | Unit + runtime guard |
| Metadata filters | PASS | VHD + real indexes |
| Plain content index | PASS | VHD integration |
| DOCX extraction | PASS | Worker runtime |
| XLSX extraction | PASS | Worker runtime/fallback |
| PPTX extraction | PASS | Worker runtime/fallback |
| PDF extraction | PASS | Built-in fallback end-to-end |
| Hostile parser-worker matrix | PASS | Commit `e2be944`: hang/crash/partial stdout/invalid UTF-8/oversized response; corrupt + encrypted PDF; corrupt OOXML; 8,193-entry OOXML bomb; 256 MiB Job Object |
| Transactional installer abrupt-exit matrix | PASS | Commit `747702d`: 7 SCM boundaries, exit 197 + separate-process recovery, previous binary/config/index/service restored; live production service unchanged |

| Cross-volume duplicate detection | PASS | Physical validation |
| Quarantine -> restore -> purge | PASS | Physical validation |
| Cleanup protected-path deny | PASS | Unit/runtime |
| Tiny intent router | PASS | Unit/runtime |
| Web resolver sanitizer/cache | PASS | Unit tests |
| Web resolver real success request | BLOCKED | Validation host has no SEARCH_TOOL_GOOGLE_KEY / SEARCH_TOOL_GOOGLE_CX; requires real credentials |
| Native Win32 GUI startup | PASS | Physical Windows |
| Single instance / resident mode | PASS | Physical Windows |
| Ctrl+Alt+Space fallback hotkey | PASS | Real key injection hide/show |
| Alt+Space primary hotkey | EXPECTED FALLBACK | Windows reserves/conflicts on host |
| Multi-monitor mixed-DPI | BLOCKED | `display-validation.ps1` now probes monitors/DPI, exercises GUI moves and supports prepare/verify topology recovery; current remote surface exposes one 1024x768 100% DPI display, so physical mixed-DPI evidence is still required |
| Windows SCM service | PASS | Real C: SearchToolIndexer Running + Automatic, service_sync=Ok, last_error=0 |
| Crash/restart soak | PASS | 15-minute soak |
| 15-minute soak | PASS | Two runs; one ~914 s / 14,352 ops / 598 checks |
| 60-minute soak | PASS | Commit `709cc275`: 3613.77 s / 56,496 ops / 2,354 checks / 15.63 ops/s; crash-restart exercised; peak service working set 5.199 MiB; final D: cleanup delta=0, metadata/sizes/content fresh, verify-deep PASS. |
| Real 1M+ search latency matrix | PASS | 1,209,697-record frozen C: index, 5 warmups + 100 rounds/class. p50/p95/p99 ms: exact 27.750/32.206/39.736; prefix 61.983/67.694/68.776; fuzzy 458.443/478.590/497.988; filtered 60.065/66.107/78.889; relationship 130.016/151.995/158.008; content 145.325/155.821/184.094. Evidence `search-latency-matrix-20260929.json`, source `322fb4e`. |
| 6-hour soak | TODO | Confidence test |
| 24-hour soak | TODO | Confidence test |
| Foreground-impact | PASS | p95 23.838 ms -> 25.131 ms representative run |
| Clean install/uninstall smoke | PASS | Release gate |
| Upgrade preserve/purge | PASS | Physical validation |
| Defender active scan | BLOCKED | 2026-09-29 host reports Antivirus/RealTime/Antispyware/BehaviorMonitor disabled |
| SmartScreen | BLOCKED | `smartscreen-validation.ps1` records policy, MOTW, signature and observed Warned/Blocked outcome; current host has no usable enabled policy/MOTW, so clean-Windows evidence is still required |
| Sleep/resume | PASS | Real C: controlled sleep/resume; pre/post markers visible, boot session unchanged, checkpoint advanced, service Running/Automatic, doctor + verify-deep PASS; `power-cycle-sleep-20260929.json` |
| Reboot recovery | PASS | Real reboot: boot session changed, SearchToolIndexer auto-started Running/Automatic, pre/post markers visible, checkpoint advanced, service_sync=Ok, doctor + verify-deep PASS; 45 s harness false-negative reproduced then fixed with configurable 120 s catch-up window |
| Compaction publish kill-point | PASS | 11 deterministic abrupt-process-exit boundaries exercised; mixed-generation publish bug fixed; verify-deep + retry compaction + debris cleanup PASS |
| Celeron + 4 GB + HDD | BLOCKED | Current host is Ryzen 5 2600X / ~16 GiB / SATA SSD; physical reference hardware still required |
