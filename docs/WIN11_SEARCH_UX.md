# Windows 11 Search continuity: native-like flyout iteration

The product goal is to improve search speed without making users learn a new interaction.

## Implemented in this iteration
- Resident Search Tool popup is anchored just above the taskbar using the selected monitor's work area; it is clamped for narrow screens and negative multi-monitor origins.
- The independent standalone window keeps its earlier placement for compatibility.
- Resident popup closes on loss of activation, as users expect from a search flyout.
- Signature/default-looking resident sessions resolve to Windows' system appearance; explicit alternative appearance presets remain available.
- No permanent vivid accent rail in Native result rows, muted Native selection background, compact ellipsis appearance control, simpler title and subtitle.
- Unit tests cover ordinary, ultra-wide, compact and negative-monitor work areas.
- Native Windows Search, Win+S, taskbar, Start, and File Explorer remain owned by Windows. The legacy keyboard bridge stays opt-in.

## Acceptance requirements not yet satisfied
- Record an actual *Windows 11* reference Search flyout's screen bounds, scaling, focus transitions, keyboard navigation and visual structure at relevant resolutions.
- Compare the independently launched GUI's position, size, hierarchy and focus behavior against those measurements, not an assumed pixel-for-pixel clone.
- Confirm opening Windows Search from its taskbar button and Win+S has unchanged native behavior. There is no supported API in this project for substituting a third-party Win32 surface *inside* the Windows SearchHost flyout. Exact same launch surface and zero behavioral difference must not be marked PASS without an independently verified, supportable integration path.
- Validate search semantics: app/settings/file matching, ranking, keyboard-first navigation, IME, pointer/touch, high contrast and screen-reader behavior.
- Do not modify the installed production ZIP/service/index until physical GUI review, sealed build, rollback and Windows CI gates are complete.

## Out-of-scope physical gate
The previous mixed-DPI hardware gate is no longer a required user deliverable: GitHub Issue #6 was closed as `not_planned`. Its historical `BLOCKED` release evidence remains in the audit record, not a reason to hold the already VALIDATED native-polish production release. Do not fabricate a passing hardware test.
